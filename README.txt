The Warwick Model with Waning and Boosters

This is a slimmed down version of the standard Warwick model, which includes waning of vaccine efficacy, slower waning of immunity from infection and boosters.

The full version of the code uses the posterior distributions from an MCMC algorithm, whereas this version uses a single parameter set for each of the three assumptions about asymptotic waning immunity.

The full version also uses the historic pattern of vaccine delivery in the UK, whereas this version uses an approximation to the number of daily doses administered together with a systematic method of allocation in priority order. (The detailed vaccine delivery data is not sharable for reasons of confidentiality.)
